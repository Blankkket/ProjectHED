Hi! This is a "translation form" for ProjectHED.
If you would like to contribute a translation for ProjectHED, please read ALL of the following:

1. Fork this repository.

2. On your fork, make a duplicate of this file (_Template.txt) in the same directory.

3. Name the file you just made as "<Language>.txt". Please use the English term for the filename.
   For example, a 日本語 translation would require the file to be named "Japanese.txt".
   Likewise, an Español translation should have the file named as "Spanish.txt".

4. Fill in all the empty quotations with the string that translates the text.
   The strings will be listed in this format:
   [Type]
   (Variables)
   "Original Text"
   "Translated Text"
   
   The "Type" specifies what the text will be used for (headings, messages, alerts, choices, buttons, prompts, labels).
   Some words can be translated differently depending on their usage, so the usage of the text will be defined here.
   
   Some strings will require a variable in the text, such as a number for a counter.
   Variables in a string (enclosed within quotation marks) will be surrounded like <this>.
   In a translation, please keep the variable as it appeared in the original text.
   Any variables will be explained in the (Variables) section which is after the "Translated Text" string.
   For example, a counter displaying the amount of errors will appear untranslated as "Errors: <x>".
   This string will be translated in Japanese to "エラー： <x>".
   
   Strings that contain quotation marks (") will be "escaped" (\").
   If your language uses quotation marks, please retain the escaped usage of these quotation marks (\").
   For example, "\Hello, world!\"" will will be translated in Español to "\"¡Hola, mundo!\"".
   If your language uses other characters to represent text in quotations, you can replace the escaped quotation with the character.
   For example, "\Hello, world!\"" will will be translated in Japanese to "「こんにちは、世界！」".
   
   Some strings may contain parts that should not be translated.
   Parts of a string that should not be translated will be surrounded in {braces}.
   If we wanted to translate the phrase "Hello, world!" but keep "world" in English, the untranslated string would be written as:
   "\"Hello, {world}!\""
   Translating this string to Japanese would result in "「こんにちは、world！」".
   The text "ProjectHED" should not be translated; it is a proper noun.
   
   Comments about the string will start with two forward slashes (//).
   This will provide extra (potentially helpful) information.
   For example:
   "Hello, world!" // This is a standard greeting.
   
5. Commit the changes.

6. Push the changes to the remote.

7. Create a pull request to the main repository after all translations have been completed.
